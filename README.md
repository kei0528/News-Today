Thank you for interesting in my application. \
This is a SPA, which you can read news from many diffrent sources.

## Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
After installing all libraries `npm install`\
you can run:\
`npm start`

I noticed too late, that this API allows us to fetch news only on localhost enviroment. If you have registered, you can enter your API Key after starting the app.

## Story about development

Because I did not know much about react router at the beginning of the development, this app is developed without any routing library. Also this is one of my first project, where I used SCSS to write stylesheets. It was all learn by doing.

Because of the pandemic, it is necessary to collected current situation. So I decided to create a news website. I found a great Web API to collect news from different sources, that is "News API". This is a great Web API, but working with this API was the largest mistake while developing this app. Namely this API allows to fetch data only on localhost environment. I noticed that to late. \
What I learned through developing this application was â€¦ READ DOC TO THE END!
